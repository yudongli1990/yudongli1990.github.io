Numerical modeling of the thermal plasma process was carried out based on the thermal plasma reactor in our lab and confirmed using experimental data. The inlet boundary conditions of a non-transferred DC arc thermal plasma reactor were used in modeling the temperature and fluid flow distribution in the reactor. Different mesh grid sizes were used to confirm the model is independent of grid size. Temperature profile and gas flow distribution in the thermal plasma reactor were developed by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with ANSYS Fluent. The predicted temperatures are in good agreement with the experimentally measured temperatures in the reactor. The influence of plasma torch input power as well as the plasma gas flux on the temperature distribution was investigated using this model. The influence of power input and gas flow rate on temperature and velocity distributions are not independent. Generally, higher power input and lower gas flow rate will give rise to the temperature increase in the reactor.
