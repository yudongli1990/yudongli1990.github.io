This paper is to study penetration depth in new anode structure electrolytic cell by cold water model experiment. New structure anodes and new structure cathodes were designed to examine penetration depth induced by anodic gas in the electrolytic cell. The results revealed the effect of different parameters such as slit width, anode–cathode distance, electrolyte level, and gas rate on the penetration depth. The results provide several meaningful suggestions in selecting electrolysis apparatus. Finally, through dimensional analyzing, the penetration depth criterion equation of the 1/2 anode structure electrolytic cell was obtained. In sum, water model experimental results provide theoretical and experimental basis for the new anode structure and new cathode structure electrolysis cell’s design and practice
