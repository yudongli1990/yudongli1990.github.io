Work experience
======

* Fall 2018: Student Assistant , The University of Alabama High Performance Computing
  * Supercomputer system administration/troubleshooting at the University of Alabama High Performance Computing (UAHPC) group
  * Studied GPU computing performance with CUDA using Matlab and LAMMPS.
  * Provided user support on software (ANSYS Fluent, OpenFOAM, LAMMPS).
  
* Summer 2018: Apprentice Intern-Material Science Engineer, Kennametal
  * Lead a R&D project to develop polymer-ceramics composite for low temperature wear-resistant coating. The coating developed is 3~4 time better than competitors.
  * Studied effect of epoxy formulation, bonding between epoxy and different ceramics (carbides, oxides), and filler addition (carbide and oxide powders/fibers) on coating performance
  * Tested coating performance (abrasion/erosion/corrosion). Microstructure of coating was analyzed using KEYENCE 3D microscope
  * Lead a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) committee. Developed procedures in handling hazardous chemicals.

Research experience
======


  
* Research Assistant, The University of Alabama (Aug. 2014 - May 2018)

  _Dissertation: Experimental and numerical study of the reduction of silica in a thermal plasma reactor_
  * Constructed and improved an in-house thermal plasma reactor system (Phoenix Solutions Corp. PT-50C) for direct methane reduction of oxides (SiO2, Fe2O3) to produce ultra-fine carbides and composites.
  * Designed/conducted experiments to establish a correlation between the reactor temperature profile with operating parameters (plasma power and gas flow).
  * Quantified products (addressing amorphous SiO2) using advanced XRD quantitative phase analysis.
  * Developed a new heterogeneous reaction kinetic rate expression to model CH4â€“SiO2 (gas-solid) reaction kinetics in the reactor. Designed/conducted experiments to parameterize the kinetic rate equation.
  * Developed and validated a multi-physics CFD model to study the transport phenomena in the reactor.
  * Developed customized algorithms to implement heterogeneous chemical reaction kinetics for particle-gas interaction and plasma nozzle boundary condition using UDFs and DPM-UDS.
  * Optimized particle combustion kinetics parameters for product prediction by implementing a custom algorithm to integrate Matlab with ANSYS Fluent.

  _Class Projects:_
  * Reaction kinetics study of SiO2 reduction by carbon using TGA/DSC. A solid-solid reaction model was proposed.
  * Developed aluminum alloy strip casting CFD model using ANSYS Fluent for a twin-roller caster. Pull speed influence on the temperature distribution was studied.
  * Developed FEA model for an impact deformation/failure process in cold spray using Abaqus.
